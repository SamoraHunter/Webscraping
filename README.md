Selenium, python, proxies. 


<Python Mozilla Firefox start with checked proxy from list>
  Firefox does not offer a way to programatically start the browser with a specified proxy in windows. 

  By writing to its stored profile file directly, the proxy settings can be specified. 

  *This is already possible in selenium with firefox and firefox can be launched with easily specified proxy settings, this however will use the vanilla firefox browser

  which cannot be called with selenium.
